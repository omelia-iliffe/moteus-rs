# moteus-rs

This crate provides an easy-to-use protocol for communicating with and controlling
the [Moteus brushless motor drivers](https://mjbots.com/) from mjbots.

It currently supports the mjbots [FdCanUsb](https://github.com/mjbots/fdcanusb) transport using
the [fdcanusb](https://crates.io/crates/fdcanusb) crate.

This crate is a work in progress but most features are implemented.
Feedback is very welcome.
